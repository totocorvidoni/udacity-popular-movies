# Popular Movies Project for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree

This project relies on TheMovieDB's API. As such, you need to use your own API key to properly use the app.

First create your own API key following the steps detailed on [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction]

Once you have your own API key you should add it as a new variable  called `MovieApiKey` into `gradle.properties` (Project)

```
// gradle.properties

MovieApiKey="<YourApiKey>"
```
